# Conversion-Transformation-Operation-and-Conditional-Expression-in-Python
# Basic Data Types Conversion
We can convert the default data types by using the standard type conversion function : float(), int(), and str().

* Convert from-and-to string using str()
From-and-to-string conversions are tested and validated
*  Convert string using mathematical expression

# Advanced Data Types Conversion
We can also convert any data types to advanced data types (list, tuple, set, dictionary) using list(), tuple(), set(), and dict().

* Convert tuple to list
* Convert set to list
* Convert dictionary to list
* Convert integer to list
* Convert float to list
* Convert string to list
* Convert list to tuple
* Convert set to tuple
* Convert dictionary to tuple
* Convert integer to tuple
* Convert float to tuple
* Convert string to tuple
* Convert list to set
* Convert dictionary to set
* Convert list to dictionary
* Convert tuple to dictionary
* Convert set to dictionary

# Input and Output 

## Variable

A variable is a place (in computer memory) to store certain data type values. To assign a value to a variable, we use the "=" operator between the variable name and the value we want to store.

## Print()
The print() function is the direct way of output to the console/screen.

## Inserting variable values ​​in strings
Python has several ways to enter a variable value in a string. 

# Number, Character, and String Transformation

* upper()
* lower()

## Prefix and Suffix

* rstrip()
* lstrip()
* strip()
* endswith()

# Replace String
replace() is an inbuilt function in the Python programming language that returns a copy of the string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring. 

# String Checking
In the string checking category we will check the boolean of a string.

* isupper()
* islower()
* isalpha()
* isalnum()
* isdecimal()
* isspace()
* istitle()

# String Formating
Set the string format as we expect
* zfill()
* rjust()
* ljust()
* center()
* String Literals
* Raw String

## Conditional Expression
Conditional Expression in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. The syntax used to create conditional control flow in Python is if, elif, and else

### *if* Condition
Used to anticipate conditions that occur during the program and determine what actions will be taken in accordance with the conditions.
If the condition evaluates to False, the if statement/condition will not be executed.

### *else* Condition
a condition where ***if*** the statement is **True** then the code in the ***if*** will be executed, but if the value is **False** then the code in the ***else*** will be executed.

### *elif* Condition
With ***elif*** we can create program code that will select several possibilities that can occur. Almost the same as the ***else*** condition, the difference is that the ***elif*** condition can be many and not just one.
